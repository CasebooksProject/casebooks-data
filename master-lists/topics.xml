This topic should be used where the problem is given as the traumatic event itself, whether that information comes from the question section or the judgment, but it should not be used where the traumatic event is proposed as a possible cause for some other medical problem. (The distinction is between a subject visiting Napier because she has fallen off a horse, and a subject visiting Napier because she has a sore neck, which she thinks she may have got from falling off a horse.)

                        <desc type="editorial">This topic is used where we know (or think) that a medical question was asked about a subject, but where no other medical topic can be supplied. It should always be given <att>evidence</att>, specifying the reason for identifying the entry as medical: <val>internal</val> if the judgment contains medical material, <val>inferred</val> if the inference is based on another component of the entry (such as treatment notes or a urine note), or <val>external</val> if the source of information is outside the case itself. A judgment stating ‘It is of (planet) in (constellation)’ can be taken as indicating a medical entry; this formula is specifically associated with medical entries and is used by the astrologers to record which planet on the chart stands for the disease. Women asking about pregnancy sometimes send their urine, so where a subject is female and the presence of urine is the only indicator that an entry is medical, it is usually safest to specify a <att>cert</att> of <val>medium</val>. If an entry includes two or more subjects, it is possible (and not uncommon) for one of those subjects to have an explicit question (and associated topics), while others are given <val>unspecifiedMedical</val>. However, an individual should not be associated with both <val>unspecifiedMedical</val> and another medical topic; <val>unspecifiedMedical</val> is a fall-back topic for ensuring an entry is designated as medical. It should not be used for recording the common phenomenon that particular symptoms are mentioned in the judgment but not in the question. Note also that for the purposes of this topic, ‘passions’ do not count as ‘medical’. A person can be given both the topic <val>unspecifiedMedical</val> and any passions topic.

It can occasionally be used based on an explicit question in the question section; more commonly it is supplied (with <att>evidence</att>) based on remarks in the judgment. Sometimes the words ‘witch’ and ‘witchcraft’ are used, sometimes the reference is to someone being ‘beworded’ or ‘under an ill tongue’. Occasionally the only clue is that the names of suspected witches are included near or in amongst the judgment. As usual, the degree of confidence with which the topic is supplied should be recorded using <att>cert</att>. Most often in Napier the judgment includes the expression ‘metuit veneficium’ or a shortened form thereof. Any references to possession are to be given this topic for now, then we can revisit and check later on. The person believed to be a victim of witchcraft should be <gi>cb:subject</gi> in the entry, and should be included as usual within this topic; but the suspected witch should be recorded separately using the <val>witchcraftSuspect</val> topic. Sometimes witchcraft is suspected in general terms, and there is no mention of an individual believed to be responsible; if that is the case, the victim alone goes into <gi>cb:topic</gi>. Note that while possession comes under this heading, <val>haunting</val> is a separate topic, and also note that for references to people who are ‘strangely handled’, ‘strangely sick’, ‘taken in strange manner’ etc. we have the topics <val>strangeAffliction</val> and <val>strangeAfflictionPassions</val>.</desc>

Occasionally the only clue is that the names of suspected witches are included near or in amongst the judgment. As usual, the degree of confidence with which the topic is supplied should be recorded using <att>cert</att>. Most often in Napier the judgment includes the expression ‘metuit veneficium’ or a shortened form thereof. The suspected witch or witches should typically be <gi>cb:object</gi>, and they alone should be included within this topic. Sometimes witchcraft is suspected in general terms, and there is no mention of an individual believed to be responsible; if that is the case, this topic should not be employed at all.

In one or two places Napier himself takes responsibility (‘R N I fl.’ or similar). We have also encountered ‘Iac punitus sev.’ (punished severely), ‘Cast I’ (from ‘castigo’, chastise), and one diary note in which a Greek term also meaning chastise was used (‘παιδευθεις I’).

It can occasionally be used based on an explicit question in the question section; more commonly it is supplied (with <att>evidence</att>) based on remarks in the judgment. Sometimes the words ‘witch’ and ‘witchcraft’ are used, sometimes the reference is to someone being ‘beworded’ or ‘under an ill tongue’. Occasionally the only clue is that the names of suspected witches are included near or in amongst the judgment. As usual, the degree of confidence with which the topic is supplied should be recorded using <att>cert</att>. Most often in Napier the judgment includes the expression ‘metuit veneficium’ or a shortened form thereof. Any references to possession are to be given this topic for now, then we can revisit and check later on. The person believed to be a victim of witchcraft should be <gi>cb:subject</gi> in the entry, and should be included as usual within this topic; but the suspected witch should be recorded separately using the <val>witchcraftSuspect</val> topic.
