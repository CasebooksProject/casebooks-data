Casebooks Project Data

In the decades around 1600, the astrologers Simon Forman and Richard Napier produced one of the largest surviving sets of medical records in history. The Casebooks Project, a team of scholars at the University of Cambridge, has transformed this paper archive into a digital archive. The data can be browsed and searched on our website (https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/). This repository provides access to our raw XML transcriptions.

The data is contained in two directories:

* cases: contains our transcription of the case files.

* master-lists: contains authority files for our topics, relations, occupations and languages.
