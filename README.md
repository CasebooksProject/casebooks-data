Casebooks Project Data

The Casebooks Project is a Wellcome Trust funded project that aims to make available the medico-astrological records of Simon Forman and Richard Napier â€” unparalleled resources in the history of early modern medicine. While the data can be browsed and searched on our website (http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/), this repository was created to give people access to our raw XML transcriptions.

The data is contained in two directories:

* cases: contains our transcription of the case files.

* master-lists: contains authority files for our topics, relations, occupations and languages.

For details on our Trancriptions Guidelines and Element Set, please see http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies/transcription-guidelines and http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies/element-set.

Since this project is still underway, this data should be considered a 'work in progress'. In addition to adding new case files, we will also be improving the granularity and accuracy of the data that has already been committed.
