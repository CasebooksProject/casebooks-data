Casebooks Project Data

The Casebooks Project is a Wellcome Trust funded project that aims to make available the astrological records of Simon Forman and Richard Napier â€” unparalleled resources in the history of early modern medicine. While the data can be browsed and searched on our website (http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/), this repository was created to give people access to our raw XML transcriptions.

The data is contained in two directories:

* cases: contains our transcription of the case files.

* master-lists: contains authority files for our topics, relations, occupations and languages. Amongst other things, they define the display versions of each of the tokens - for example, that <cb:topic key="fistula"/> should display as 'hernia, fistula and haemorrhoids'. They are also used in the schematron tests that are used to validate our files.

For details on our Trancriptions Guidelines and Element Set, please see http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies/transcription-guidelines and http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies/element-set.

Since this project is still underway, this data should be considered a 'work in progress'. In addition to adding new case files, We will also be improving the granularity and accuracy of the data that has already been committed.
